    <h1>Monetization and Marketing of Shooting Game</h1>
    
    <h5>Marketing Strategy</h5>
    <p>
     It’s common to rely on known clichés and stereotypes. This can be a risk considering that it’s more<br> and more
    common today to see a multitude of people coming from different social spheres interested in all sorts of things.<br>
    On the other hand, it’s a risk that all developers and publishers are ready to take since the gain of targeting a<br>
    specific demographics is incomparable to that of losing sales due to a marketing campaign that wasn’t aimed at the<br>
    right audience.Nevertheless, targeting an audience does not guarantee success every time. A lot of money can be spent<br>
    in a marketing campaign that is completely off the mark, or a game developed for the wrong audience.<br>
    These can have disastrous consequences.Unfortunately, there is no certain way to know if your target audience is the<br>
    right one when you launch your game. That’s why it’s all the more important to put the time and resources to better<br>

        for a full game and not be bothered again with additional purchases or ads. Many of these ad networks <br> 
        are doing nasty stuff to users and possibly to you as a developer too, so I'd steer clear of them. <br> 
        Instead, make something of quality that is worth paying a one time fee for.

      The time when a customer used to receive a full game for a certain price is gradually passing by as <br> 
        more and more free-to-play games emerge on the horizon. This leaves developers to question how  <br> 
        to make a game profitable without implementing a repugnant money-grabbing system. Like any  <br> 
        intriguing question, it barely has a simple answer as there are still various examples of  <br> 
        the games managing to stay relevant and highly lucrative, despite having a player-friendly <br> 
        monetization model. In other words, universally, the game needs to fit a
